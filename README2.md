# How to create a file using the Terminal

In java script if you want to create a file into a terminal you must have a repositry first and you save it inside it then create a file so it will save in it

## 1-import the module:

first we must have the node.js and git bash so both work togather to let the VS Code active and can log to it from the git bash and you first must setup the path for them.

example:

it will start with **(.)** where it mean its current place

```
.
```

## 2-creating a folder:

after creating a repositry , you create a folder inside the terminal by this way:

example:

```
mkdir (name of the folder)
```

then press enter and it will creat for us a file

## 3-creating a file:

We create a files inside that folder we creat by (mkdir) in the terminal, so we can work on them on the vs code.

example:

```
touch index.html app.js
```

this will create for us an html and java script file.

## 4-scrolling between the files and folders:

after creating the files and folders you need to access them.

**cd (the name of the file or folder you want to access to)**

```
cd ga/unit1
```

> notice:this will take me to a folder named as ga then it will stop at unit1 folder.

## 5-knowign what each file contain:

if you don't know what each file contain you can let this function show you all the available files or folder inside it.

**first**:

```
cd ga/unit1
```

**then**:

```
ls
```

## ls will show what unit1 contain
